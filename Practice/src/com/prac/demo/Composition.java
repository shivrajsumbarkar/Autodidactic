/**
 * Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other. 
 * It represents part-of relationship.
 * In composition, both entities are dependent on each other.
 * When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.
 * 
 * Child object wont exist without parent strong relationship between objects
 * Ex::House (Parent) and Room (Child)
 * In above example a library can have no. of books on same or different subjects. 
 * So, If Library gets destroyed then All books within that particular library will be destroyed. 
 * i.e. book can not exist without library. That’s why it is composition.
